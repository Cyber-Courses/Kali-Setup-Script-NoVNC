# Kali Setup Script (NoVNC)

## Overview

The "Kali Setup Script (NoVNC)" is an automated setup script designed to streamline the installation and configuration of a Kali Linux environment with NoVNC support. This script is perfect for users who want a quick and efficient way to get a Kali Linux instance up and running, complete with NoVNC for remote desktop access.

## Features

- Automated installation of necessary packages and dependencies
- Configuration of NoVNC for remote desktop access
- System updates and optimizations
- Easy-to-follow instructions

## Requirements

- A fresh installation of Kali Linux
- Internet connection
- Root privileges

## Installation

1. Clone the git repository to your Kali Linux machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyber-Courses/Kali-Setup-Script-NoVNC.git
```
2. Ensure the script has executable permissions:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```
3. Run the script as root:
    ```bash
    sudo ./setup.sh
    ```

## Usage

After running the script, your Kali Linux environment will be set up with NoVNC configured for remote desktop access. To access your Kali Linux instance remotely, you can use SSH port forwarding.

### SSH Port Forwarding

To forward the NoVNC port through SSH, use the following command:
```bash
ssh kali@192.168.13.37 -L 8081:localhost:8081
```

Replace `kali@192.168.13.37` with the appropriate username and IP address of your Kali Linux machine.

### Access NoVNC

After setting up the SSH tunnel, open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8081/
```

## Setting Up a Kali Linux VM on Azure

This script is particularly useful for setting up a Kali Linux VM on Azure. Follow these steps to create a VM on Azure and use this script:

1. **Log in to Azure Portal:**
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Create a New VM:**
   - Navigate to "Virtual Machines" and click on "Add" to create a new VM.
   - Choose "[Kali Linux](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/GalleryItemDetailsBladeNopdl/id/kali-linux.kali)" from the list of available images.
   - Configure the VM size, region, and other settings as needed.
   - Download SSH Key

3. **Configure Network Settings:**
   - Ensure that the VM has a public IP address.
   - Configure the inbound port rules to allow SSH (port 22) and the NoVNC port (port 8081).

4. **Access the VM:**
   - Once the VM is created, connect to it using SSH:
     ```bash
     chmod 600 kali_key.pem
     ssh -i kali_key.pem your_username@your_vm_public_ip
     ```

5. **Run the Setup Script:**
   - Download the `setup.sh` script to your Kali Linux VM.
   - Ensure the script has executable permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x setup.sh
     ```
   - Run the script as root:
     ```bash
     sudo ./setup.sh
     ```

6. **Set Up SSH Port Forwarding:**
   - On your local machine, use SSH port forwarding to access NoVNC:
     ```bash
     ssh -i kali_key.pem your_username@your_vm_public_ip -L 8081:localhost:8081
     ```

7. **Access NoVNC:**
   - Open your web browser and go to:
     ```
     http://localhost:8081/
     ```
