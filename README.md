# Kali Setup Script (NoVNC)

## Overview

The "Kali Setup Script (NoVNC)" is an automated setup script designed to streamline the installation and configuration of a Kali Linux environment with NoVNC support. This script is perfect for users who want a quick and efficient way to get a Kali Linux instance up and running, complete with NoVNC for remote desktop access.

## Features

- Automated installation of necessary packages and dependencies
- Configuration of NoVNC for remote desktop access
- System updates and optimizations
- Easy-to-follow instructions

## Requirements

- A fresh installation of Kali Linux
- Internet connection
- Root privileges

## Installation

1. Download the `setup.sh` script to your Kali Linux machine.
2. Ensure the script has executable permissions:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```
3. Run the script as root:
    ```bash
    sudo ./setup.sh
    ```

## Usage

After running the script, your Kali Linux environment will be set up with NoVNC configured for remote desktop access. To access your Kali Linux instance remotely, you can use SSH port forwarding.

### SSH Port Forwarding

To forward the NoVNC port through SSH, use the following command:
```bash
ssh kali@192.168.13.37 -L 8081:localhost:8081
```

Replace `kali@192.168.13.37` with the appropriate username and IP address of your Kali Linux machine.

### Access NoVNC

After setting up the SSH tunnel, open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8081/
```
